    <p> What is Python?<br> </p>
        <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br></p>

         <p>What can Python do?<br> </p>

    <p>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
    Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
    Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
    Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.<br>

    <p>History of Python,<br> </p>

   <p> Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum, its planning started on late 1980's and implementation starts on 1989 and published 1991 (labeled version 0.9.0).<br>

      It is derived from ABC Language.<br>
      It combines both easiness of ABC and power of C Programming.<br>
      Python was named for the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.<br>
      Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release). 
      Statements and control flow</p>

    <p>Python's statements include:</p><br>
    <p>The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =
    if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if)<br>
    <ul>
    <li> for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block</li><br>
    <li> while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true
        <li>The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups[86]); it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits</li><br>
            <li>The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception</li>
                <li>The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming</li><br>
                    <li>The def statement, which defines a function or method
                        <li>The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom</li><br>
                            <li>The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom</li><br>
                                <li>The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom</li><br>
                                    <li>The break statement, which exits a loop</li>
                                        <li>The continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next</li><br>
                                            <li>The del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined</li><br>
                                                <li>The pass statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block</li><br>
                                                    <li>The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply</li><br>
                                                        <li>The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines</li><br>
    The return statement, used to return a value from a function<br>
    The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program<br>
    The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.<br>
    Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[90] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.<br>
